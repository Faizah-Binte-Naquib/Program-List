# ### 11. Write a recursive function to obtain the first 25 numbers of a Fibonacci sequence. In a Fibonacci sequences the sum of two successive terms given the third term. Following are the first few term of the Fibonacci sequence: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55â€¦
# 
# * Function: fibonacci()
# * Summary: finds fibonaci numbers recursively 
# * Input: n
# * Output: fibonacci numbers
